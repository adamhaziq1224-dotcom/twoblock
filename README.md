# 2Block Ai — Intelligent Adaptive Learning & Teacher Intervention Platform

> **Google Developer Groups (GDG) Hackathon Project**  
> *Transforming KSSR Primary Education with Real-Time Learning Gap Detection, Adaptive Practice, and Teacher Intervention Workflows.*

---

## 🌟 Executive Summary

**2Block Ai** is a full-stack, dual-sided educational intelligence platform designed to address the critical challenge in contemporary primary education: **identifying and closing student learning gaps before they compound into chronic academic struggle.**

Traditional classrooms often rely on end-of-term exams that deliver diagnostic insights too late for meaningful remediation. **2Block Ai** bridges the gap between learners and educators through:
1. **A student-centric adaptive learning arena** featuring game-like survival practice, live mastery tracking, and personalized next-step recommendations.
2. **An educator intelligence suite** providing class health scoring, early risk signals, 1-click guided intervention plans, and print-ready progress reports.

### Core Architecture Components
* **Adaptive Scoring & Diagnostic Engine:** Evaluates question difficulty against real-time student response latencies and accuracy using moving average calibration (`previous * 0.7 + current * 0.3`).
* **Supabase Integration & Row Level Security (RLS):** Enforces data isolation ensuring student profiles, attempts, and diagnostics are strictly partitioned while granting teachers designated access to class cohorts.
* **Resilient Dual-Mode Execution:** Operates seamlessly with cloud Supabase credentials, falling back cleanly to an offline persistent data store for uninterrupted demonstration.
